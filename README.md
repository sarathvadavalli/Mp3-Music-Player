# Mp3-Music-Player
I completed this project as my 2nd task in Code Clause internship. (Python development) 
It uses the tkinter module to create an interactive user inteface and filedialog to access the files from our system.
It provides 4 control buttons to operate:
1) Play
2) Pause
3) Resume
4) Stop
