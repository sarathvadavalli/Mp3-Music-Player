# Mp3-Music-Player
I completed this project as my 2nd task in Code Clause internship. (Python development) 

Overview:

Music players are very popular these days because music has become popular. This is why music players like Spotify, Wynk and Gaana have become popular because they bring music closer to people. This python music player project is also similar to it and its objective is to build an own GUI based mp3 music player.
This project is done mainly using 2 libraries:
1) 'tkinter' to create a user-friendly interface
2) 'pygame' to load and play music
   
It also uses 'filedialog' module to access the files from our system.
It provides 4 control buttons to operate:
1) Play
2) Pause
3) Resume
4) Stop
